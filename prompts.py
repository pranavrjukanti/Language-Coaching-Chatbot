TEXT: {text}

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHORT TEXTS:
- For very short texts (1-7 words), be more lenient in your analysis.
- Focus on obvious errors and provide gentle suggestions.
- If the text is a single word or very short phrase, it's okay to mark it as 'perfect' unless there are clear errors.


Respond in STRICT JSON format:
{{
    "original": "original text",
    "corrected": "corrected version" | "Input Correct" | null if unclear,
    "language": "detected language | 'Mixed' | 'Unclear'",
    "status": "perfect | imperfect | unclear",
    "errors": [
        {{
            "type": "grammar/spelling/punctuation/word_order/vocabulary",
            "original": "incorrect segment",
            "corrected": "fixed version",
            "explanation": "error reason in detected language"
        }}
    ],
    "notes": [
        "Any contextual observations about the text"
    ]
}}

RULES:
1. DECISION TREE:
   A. If text is PERFECT:
      - "status": "perfect"
      - "corrected" = "original"
      - "errors": []
      - Add positive reinforcement in "notes"

   B. If text has grammatical ERRORS:
      - "status": "Incorrect"
      - Correct ALL identifiable mistakes
      - Explain each error in its language

   C. If text is UNCLEAR (gibberish/mixed/undecipherable):
      - "status": "unclear"
      - "corrected": null
      - "language": "Unclear"
      - "errors": []
      - Add reason in "notes"

2. Strict requirements:
   - Never guess corrections for unclear text
   - Mark ambiguous cases as "unclear"
   - For borderline cases, add "possible_errors" in notes
   - Mixed languages → "language": "Mixed"
   - Code/numbers/symbols → Flag in "notes"
   - For non-language: Set "language" to "Unknown"
